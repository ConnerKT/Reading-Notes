## Getting Started with Web Dev.

Installing the software, starting simple, use HTML, CSS, and then JavaScript.

Think of an idea, write the basic things you want, and how you want it to look.

This helps you structure your web page according to your design. This takes practice.

## JavaScript

Its based off interactivity: games, animated 2D and 3D graphics, comprehensive database-driven apps, and more!

Compact yet flexible!

Variables store values
ex. let myVariable;

Variables can contain different data types:

Strings - text.

number- a number?

boolean - true or false statement.

Array - a list, multiple values

Object - Everything in JS is an object and can be stored in a variable.

My poem...

1. The browser sends a request to the site.
2. The browser looks up the ip for you
3. This is the HTTP request you did type!
4. The server sends back the copy of the site, its a cue!

When parsing a site, the HTML is intiated and a DOM tree is created. Then CSS is next, and constructs its own tree. JavaScript then goes last, and does the same.

On google images when searching images you can add it so it only shows images in a certificate thats copyright free.

In Javascript a string is created surrounded by "".
Numbers are created by putting the number.
A variable stores values, this can be any object, which is important in javascript because it lets us do what we do!

## Intro to HTML

1. An HTML attribute is something you put on an element to help it function.

2. An HTML element contains its body, header, main, and footer.

3. Section is for grouping similar content, and article is for related content.

4. It usually contains the head, the body, maybe an header, a navbar, and more!

5. It helps with showing the title of the page, and the description to sort between all different sites.

6. It helps specify data on the site for certain feature like the language it uses, or if its UTF-8.

## Misc

1. Think about what you want to create, and it will lead from there.

2. What do I want to accomplish?

### Semantics

1. You would use h1 to to style the text you want to stand out on the top, span is used to style text in any way you want.

2. It helps with making the web page easier to read.

### JavaScript

1.  Adding interactivity and making a web page more complex with deeper features.

2. You can eitehr inline in the text with the script tag, or source an external file in the script tag.

## Things I want to know more about

How hard and complex can HTML and CSS go?

Is practice the best method to become a better programmer?
