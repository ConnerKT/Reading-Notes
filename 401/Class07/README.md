# Interfaces

This topic is important to me so I can build a deeper understanding of OOP principles, and learn how to manage my code.

## Interfaces

Defining behavior for multiple types.

Contains definitions for a group of related functionalities that a non-abstract class or a struct must implement.

In C#, an interface is a reference type that defines a contract or a set of member signatures that a class must implement. It allows you to define a common set of methods, properties, and events that classes can adhere to, enabling polymorphism and providing a way to achieve abstraction.

## Back to Basics

The basic problem an interface is trying to solve is to separate how we use something from how it is implemented.

Interfaces are trying to solve a very specific problem by allowing us to interact with objects based on what they do, not how they do it.

If we have a class that implements an interface, we can be sure that it will support all the methods that are defined in that interface.

## Interfaces #2

An interface defines a contract. Any class or struct that implements that contract must provide an implementation of the members defined in the interface. 

## Things I want to know more about

I want to know when I will use this in my major applications to make more code better.
I want to be able to understand the differences between many of the OOP principles.
