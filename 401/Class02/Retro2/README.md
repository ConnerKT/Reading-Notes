# Unit Testing Notes

This topic is important to me because I want to be able to know on how to create my own test to run on my code.

## XUnit Notes

**Unit Testing** is similar to a method, you write it to isolate and exercise specific units of your code.

For example we can create a new instance of our program and test a part of it, if your program doesn't fullfill the condition we send back an error.

It helps catches bug early, improves your code quality, and encourages better coding practices.

To create a unit test project you just have to find the xUnit test Project on VS.

## ReadMe Notes

[ReadMe Best Practices](https://github.com/jehna/readme-best-practices).

Having a good README lets a user know the purpose an application and more information about it.

Having one that is organized and easy to navigate allows not only the creator, but any collaborators to work well.

Using items such as images, badges, and logos help make the README more presentable without just being a wall of text.
Adding more content to the README fleshes it out, gives it personality, and lets the user get involved with your project.

It suggests including sections such as project description, installation instructions, usage examples, documentation links, and contribution guidelines.

## Things I want to know more about

I want to know more about how to develop expansive test cases so I can test full applications.

I want to understand how hard it is to develop these test and maintain them overtime.
