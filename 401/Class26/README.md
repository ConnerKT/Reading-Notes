## MVC Basics

**MVC** is a design pattern or architecture which helps in developing the web application in a most efficient way when compared with the traditional ASP.NET Web App.

In traditional ASP.NET web application appraoch, the user action and view (UI) are combined, whereas in MVC, the View only deals with UI of the page and the user actions are defined in Controller.

Basically, MVC makes the design of the app intro three layers namely, Model, View, and Controller. They all handle their own part of the application.

**Model** layer represents the objects in our App. Model is also a class which has all the objects and its properties defined and methods defined in it.

**View** layer has all the html controls which define the UI of the application.

**Controller** basically handles the request from user. Heart of the MVC application as everyone says.

## Bootstrap

**Bootstrap** is a popular open-source front-end framework used for creating responsive and visually appealing web designs.

**Pros:**

1. **Rapid Development:** Bootstrap allows for quick and efficient development of websites and web applications.
2. **Responsive Design:** It ensures your website looks good and functions well on various devices and screen sizes.
3. **Pre-built Components:** Bootstrap provides a wide range of pre-designed and customizable components, such as navigation bars, modals, and carousels, saving development time.
4. **Cross-browser Compatibility:** It ensures consistent appearance and functionality across different web browsers.
5. **Community Support:** It has a large community, offering support, documentation, and a plethora of third-party themes and plugins.

**Cons:**

1. **Generic Look:** Overuse of Bootstrap can result in a generic appearance if not customized sufficiently.
2. **File Size:** The file size can be relatively large, impacting load times, especially if not optimized properly.
3. **Learning Curve:** Novice users may find it challenging to fully understand and utilize all of Bootstrap's features and customization options.
4. **Dependency:** Over-reliance on Bootstrap can hinder learning and understanding of core CSS and HTML concepts.
5. **Overhead for Unused Features:** Including the entire Bootstrap library for a project may lead to unnecessary code bloat if not all features are used.

## Things I want to know more about

I want to understand more about Razor pages and the difference between it and React.

I want to know more about MVC, and why it could be better alternative then compared to something like node.
