# Practice in the Terminal

## The Command Line

[Source](https://ryanstutorials.net/linuxtutorial/commandline.php)

The command line is a cool way to interact with our computer. navigate, and also create and destroy items. It allows you, if you know the specific commands, to navigate quickly through your system and open up specific files. Its a great way to practice moving in an environment without GUI, and is good practice about a programmer.

## Basic Navigation

Even though the CLI doesn't have a GUI, it has commands that can be used to interact with your computer. You can get tons of information where you are, whats in this file, and more. Commands like ls, pwd, and mkdir, are key commands that let us communicate with the command line.

## More About Files

In this page, we learn about different commands to identify files, specifically ones with different extension types, and that everything is essentially a file. So it tells us that Linux is an extentionless system. Also it points out that case sensitivity is important, because it can lead to you not finding the file you need.

## Manual Pages

A cool thing is, you don't need to know everything! When confused about what a command does, or what you need after using a command, manual pages are essential. In your CLI, you can use man (command) to find more information about the command. It helps you to get informed about a specific command without needing to google.

## File Manipulation

Like mentioned before, the navigation system in the command line is powerful, but it also is powerful for manipulating files too. You can make, delete, copy, move, and more just from your command line. An important take away I got from this page was that you can't undo your actions, unlike having a GUI, your actions can't be undone so be careful!

I included this page because of the useful information it pertains. If I ever need to find a specific command and I'm confused (which will happen when using different platforms), I can always reference this page for help in the CLI.
