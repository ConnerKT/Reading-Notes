## Notes

SQL from what I learned is a language we use to access a database. We use it to go through, remove, and also manage data in our database.

You can create a database, and then creature a structured table which you can file with columns and data so we can have a structure to follow for following data.

Basic SQL commands

INSERT: used to add new data to a database.

SELECT: used to retrieve data from a database.

DELETE: used to delete data from a database.

UPDATE: used to modify existing data in a database.
