## Retro Answers

1. I think if I don't write down on how to make api calls, get,push etc I'll forget.
2. I learned about how to get data from api's and how to store them.
3. I should probably not worry about copying down from documents on how to do it, because its new and I should remember for the future.
4. I think Api's as a whole, but its a new topic so with more practice I'll become great.
