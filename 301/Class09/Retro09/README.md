## Retro Answers

1. If I don't study my organization and keep it up, I feel like I'll get worse at it.
2. I learned about including my imports into my app.get, which seems very useful for cleaning up code.
3. I should probably learn to break these things down more, and get my instructors to explain the instructions if I don't understand them.
4. What still puzzles me is some aspect of API's, and using express and using axios.
