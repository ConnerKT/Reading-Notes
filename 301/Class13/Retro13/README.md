## Retro Answers

1. What went well today was the partner work, me and my partner work well together so we made a lot of progress. If I don't write down on how to use the Put method, I might forget it.
2. I learned about PUT, and how it works when updating data in the database.
3. I should prepare reading the assignments task well, because I tend to get confused quickly.
4. I need to learn more about the different HTTP methods, and how to use them in my own projects.
