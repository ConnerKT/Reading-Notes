## CRUD Basics

**CRUD** is an acronym that stands for Create, Read, Update, and Delete.

It represents the four basic functions that models should be able to do.

Used to implement a persistent storage application.

Used to interact with database applications.

**Create** will create, using POST, sends data.

**READ** will grab it, GET, allows to view the data stored.

**UPDATE** will update our data, with PUT, we can replace all current data at that target source.

**DELETE** will delete data, using DELETE, it will remove the targeted data using ID.
