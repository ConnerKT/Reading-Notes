## Intro to NODE.js

Node is a program we can use to execute JavaScript on our computers (JavaScript Runtime)

Its built off the V8 engine (JavaScript Opensource engine) with file system API, an HTTP library and more utility methods.

Node can be installed through Npm or VM (version manager)

You can use npm init to install a package locally

### What is Node used for

Bunding JS files, running test and more.

It lets use run JS on the server

Only downside of this is it runs on a single thread which leads to limitations. CPU intensive operations should be decided elsewhere.

Real time applications like chat sites, building Api's, or a lot of data streaming.

## Pair Programming

Pair programming is a way for developers to develop their skills in a way thats beneficial to another person. It helps a coder develop other skills besides coding as well.
These include: Social Skills, Job readiness, and interview readiness.

There's a lot of things people don't know, or forget so coding with a peer helps eliminate that by working together and having a fellow developer over your shoulder.

## Pair Programming Questions

1. What are the 6 reasons for pair programming?
2. In your experience, which of these reasons have you found most beneficial?
3. How does pair programming work?

## Pair Programming Answers

1. Greater Efficiency, Engaged Collaboration, Learning from others, Social skills, Job interview readiness, and work environment readiness.

2. I feel like learning from others, but also social skills because I get closer with my peers when we work together and solve hard problems with eachother (leetcode).

3. Reviewing eachother codes, having one code but being told what to do.
