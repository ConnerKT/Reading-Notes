## Retro Answers

1. What went well with this lab was building it, I feel like I've gotten used to creating react apps. I might forget on node related topics until I build a foundation with it.

2. I learned about node servers, and executing them to work alongside your projects.

3. I should watch some videos on people building projects in node to see the importance of it and how its used.

4. Node in general, I understand the package manager side of it, but I want to learn more about the developer of real time apps side of it.
