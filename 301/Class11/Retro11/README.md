## Retro Answers

1. What went well was following the examples given to me during this lab to build this application, if I don't write down about how to create MERN APPs, I'll fall out of practice.
2. I learned about MongoDB, SQL, and using it in our code.
3. I should probably go ahead and look at the material we're using so I can learn it before class.
4. MongoDB overall, but its a new topic so it's gonna take time to get used to.
