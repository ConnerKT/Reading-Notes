1. Manipulating the data in the lab and changing the page is interesting, but if I don't understand why its useful I'll forget.
2. I learned about how interesting using json files to transfer data into your webpage can be.
3. I should probably break down the files one by one and try to understand it.
4. Just why everything was done in json files, which seems weird.
