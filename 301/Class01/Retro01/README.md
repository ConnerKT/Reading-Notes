# This is the Retro for this Class!

1. What went well with this assignment was most of nothing, but that's because its something new, and I want to learn it so I will get better.

2.  I learned about react and how it changes how we use DOM.

3. What I should do differently is apply my knowledge in different ways, and try to ask for help.

4. I think overall everything still confuses me but I will learn over time.
