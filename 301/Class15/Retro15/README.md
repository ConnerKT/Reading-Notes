## Retro Answers

1. What went well in the lab was the front end of the auth, which was fun to do and see the results of.
2. I learned about Auth, and I learned about how deep the concept of it goes.
3. I should probably wait for the class to get to this topic so I don't die inside.
4. I want to learn more about Auth and the deeper concepts of allowing data in our database to contain what we want, and conditionally rendering said data.
