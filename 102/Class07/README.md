## Control Flow

**Control Flow** is the order in which the computer executes statements in a script.

Code is run from the first line in the file to the last.

Things that change the control flow are structures such as conditionals and loops.

Conditionals are like if and elses.

Control flow means that when you read a script, you must not only read from start to finish but also look at program structure and how it affects order of execution.

## JavaScript Functions

A Javascript function is a block of code designed to perform a perticular task.

It is executed when something calls it.

Defining a function is done like this:
function myFunction()

A Javacript function is defined with the function keyword, followed by a name the user gives, and then ().

The parenthesis contain parameters.

The code that is supposed to be executed is done in the {}.

It is used to reuse code!

## JavaScript Operators

Assignment Operator:=.
Addition Operator:+.
Multiplication Operator:*

There are many different types of Javascript operators such as:
Arithmetic, Assignment, Comparison, Logical, conditional, and type.

## Things I want to know more about

Using JavaScript, how can you apply this to your CSS?
Can I apply JavaScript functions to CSS?
Is the conditionals of JavaScript crucial for the development of the websites, if so how?
