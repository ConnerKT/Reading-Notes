## These notes will be for the Lab assignment to make a website from scratch!

Things such as HTML, plays a key part in structuring your website.

# Wireframes

**Wireframing** is a practice used by UX designers which allows them to define and plan the information hierarchy of their design for a website, app, or product.

- How they want to process info on a site

When designing its there to show you where you might want things to go before coding said site.

A good way to know how a user uses your site, through the positioning of buttons and menus on the diagram.

Either can be drawn by hand, or some use software such as **Invision** and **Balsamiq**.

Paper drawn - easier to change and more flexible.

Software drawn - More detail orientated.

# HTML Basics

Each HTML element has an opening tag, closing tag, and the content.

This forms the thing we call an elemenet.

            <p>My Cat is very grumpy<p/>


            <p> is the opening tag.
            </p> is the closing tag.
            and the rest in the middle is the content!

Attributes can be applied to elements such as class!

You can put elements into elements, this is called nesting!

Every HTML document has essential anatomy, its important to research what to put in your head when starting a HTML document.

Ex. charset, name, content!

## Syntax

Headings are done similar to Markdown, except its h1 incased in tags!

the P tag is used for paragraphs.

Unordered list is ul!

Ordered list is ol

## Semantic Elements

**Semantic** elements are a code that is easily identifiable by its tag name. Some like article, footer, header, can be easily read and dicphered.
